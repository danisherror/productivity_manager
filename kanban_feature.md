A **Kanban board** is a powerful tool for visualizing, managing, and optimizing workflow. A fully featured Kanban board should have the following **core** and **advanced** features:

---

### üß± **Core Features**

1. **Boards & Columns**

   * Visual board representing workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
   * Customizable column names and order.

2. **Cards (Tasks/Items)**

   * Each task or work item is represented as a card.
   * Editable title, description, and other metadata.

3. **Drag-and-Drop**

   * Move cards between columns easily to reflect progress.

4. **Create / Edit / Delete Tasks**

   * Add new tasks, update details, or remove them.

5. **User Assignment**

   * Assign tasks to users or team members.

6. **Due Dates**

   * Set deadlines or due dates for tasks.

7. **Task Priority**

   * Indicate priority level (e.g., low, medium, high).

8. **Task Tags / Labels / Categories**

   * Add colored labels or tags for organization or filtering.

9. **Comments / Notes**

   * Collaborators can leave messages or notes on a task.

---

### üöÄ **Advanced Features**

1. **Subtasks / Checklists**

   * Break tasks into smaller steps and mark them as complete.

2. **File Attachments**

   * Attach documents or images to cards.

3. **Real-Time Collaboration**

   * Updates reflect instantly for all team members.

4. **Task History / Activity Log**

   * Track changes made to a card (who did what and when).

5. **Filters & Search**

   * Filter cards by tags, assignee, due date, etc.
   * Search for specific tasks quickly.

6. **Board Templates**

   * Save board configurations as templates for reuse.

7. **Notifications**

   * Email or in-app alerts for task assignment, due dates, etc.

8. **Progress Tracking**

   * Kanban metrics like cumulative flow diagrams or burndown charts.

9. **WIP Limits (Work in Progress)**

   * Set limits on the number of tasks in each column to prevent overload.

10. **Dark Mode / Theme Customization**

    * Optional UI preferences for better UX.

---

### üß† **Optional Integrations & Extras**

* Integration with:

  * Calendar apps (Google Calendar, Outlook).
  * GitHub/GitLab for developer boards.
  * Slack / Teams for updates.
  * Time tracking tools (like Toggl).
* API Access for automation or custom dashboards.
* Mobile app for on-the-go task management.

To support **all core and advanced Kanban features** you asked for, here's a well-structured **Mongoose schema design**. This schema supports:

* Boards with customizable columns
* Tasks with subtasks, tags, files, comments
* Users, assignments, due dates, priority, activity logs, etc.

---

### üßæ **User Schema**

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  avatar: String,
  role: { type: String, default: "user" }, // or "admin"
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
```

---

### üóÇÔ∏è **Board Schema**

```js
const boardSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  owner: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" },
  members: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }],
  columns: [{
    title: String,
    wipLimit: { type: Number, default: 0 }, // 0 = no limit
    order: Number,
  }],
  isTemplate: { type: Boolean, default: false },
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = mongoose.model("Board", boardSchema);
```

---

### üìù **Task (Card) Schema**

```js
const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  boardId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Board" },
  columnTitle: String, // e.g., "To Do", "In Progress"
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: String,
  assignees: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }],
  tags: [String],
  priority: { type: String, enum: ["Low", "Medium", "High"], default: "Medium" },
  dueDate: Date,
  attachments: [{
    name: String,
    url: String,
    uploadedAt: Date,
  }],
  subtasks: [{
    title: String,
    isCompleted: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  }],
  isCompleted: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  order: Number,
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = mongoose.model("Task", taskSchema);
```

---

### üí¨ **Comment Schema**

```js
const commentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  taskId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Task" },
  author: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" },
  content: String,
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = mongoose.model("Comment", commentSchema);
```

---

### üîç **Activity Log Schema (Optional)**

```js
const activitySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  taskId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Task" },
  boardId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Board" },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" },
  action: String, // e.g., "created task", "moved card", "added comment"
  metadata: Object, // additional info (e.g., {from: "To Do", to: "In Progress"})
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = mongoose.model("Activity", activitySchema);
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Optional Add-ons:

* **Notifications Schema**
* **Time Tracking Schema**
* **Label Schema** if you want dynamic colored labels

---

### üß≠ Relationships Summary

* A **Board** contains columns and members.
* A **Task** belongs to a Board and a Column (by name).
* A **Task** can have assignees, tags, attachments, subtasks.
* A **Task** can have many **Comments**.
* Actions on tasks or boards can be tracked in **Activity Logs**.
